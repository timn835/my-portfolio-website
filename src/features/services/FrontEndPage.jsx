              <b>Is this too much voodoo for our purposes?</b> According to
              Terry Davis, this is the hardest question a programmer can face.
              This has never been more true for front end developers, especially
              with the number of complex tools that are now at our disposal.
            </p>
            <p className="pb-3 text-left">
              A prime example of this is Redux, a popular state management
              library which has often become synonymous with React apps accross
              the industry. By analyzing the needs of an application, in
              particular, the complexity of the global UI state, we can make the
              right decision whether Redux is required or not.

              Forget that you are a developer. The key is to ask yourself: what
              are you building? What are the tools available for the job? Just
              because you know redux doesn't mean the Context API isn't
              sufficient. Just because you can incorporate microservices doesn't
              mean a monolith won't suffice.
            </p>
            <p className="pb-3 text-right">
              Make the right decision by considering factors such as{" "}
              <b>delivery</b> (what is our timeframe?), <b>maintainability</b>{" "}
              (are we foreseeing a lot of techical debt?), <b>re-usability</b>{" "}
              (is my code going to be used by other team members?),{" "}
              <b>scalability</b> (how many users/visitors are we foreseeing?)
              and many others. By analyzing these factors, we will choose the
              right tech stack for your project.

              <b>Absolutely.</b> In my experience in the industry, every
              top-tier front end developer is fairly skilled with HTML, CSS and
              JS. In order to understand more complex libraries and frameworks
              (React, NextJS, Tailwind), it is imperative to have a mastery of
              the things these frameworks are built upon.
            </p>
            <p className="pb-3 text-left">
              Furthermore, a vanilla tech stack is often the right choice for
              simpler short-term endeavors. Having fewer dependencies will make
              things lighter, easier, faster. By knowing how to code with
              vanilla, our clients have a much wider range of possibilities for
              their projects.
